# DSMRlogger-Next
The Next firmware for the DSMR-logger for ESP32 and ESP8266

# Important RC5: Breaking change to MQTT Messages 
With the introduction of Auto Discovery and simplified MQTT messages this also breaks current integrations based on JSON messages over MQTT.  

A couple of things about that:
1. The JSON based MQTT message code is still in the codebase, and can be switch back on.
2. Simplified MQTT messages allow for easy integration with any platform.
3. Auto Discovery will update your Home Assistant configuration. You can remove any existing configuration templates in your setup.

Please be aware of these changes, moving over to RC5 is breaking some stuff. So update your Home Assistant by removing the configuration items. 

# Hardware support
This codebase support the original ESP8266 based DSMR API logger hardware. Starting with RC5 the code is also supporting the ESP32 hardware version that is in development currently. Just select the correct hardware board and compile, it should work fine. 
# Active Development
The active development branch is currently:

**This is the FORK of the original DSMRloggerAPI from Willem Aandewiel.** 

The intent of this for is to start implementing and extend with new features, fixing bugs and trying to improve the codebase.

With the launch of the Final version of DSMRloggerAPI, version 2.0.1. This completed the last and final update of Willem and released it to the public DSMRlogger, as it complete the REST API.This fork is picking up where Willem finished the development of the REST finished, by fixing bugs, improvement to the codebas and starting to add new features to the firmware.

Willem contributed a large part of his time and effort in creating the open hardware design, making it easy ot get a PCB and components and the firmware in an Open Source way. I plan to extend building features I care about, try to fix bugs and improve code (if even possible). I thank Willem for his contribution to the community and I will keep posting the work as a fork from his original code base. 

The release candidate of DSMRlogger-Next will contain:
- Direct writting to InfluxDB;
- Fixing DSMR handling so that DSMR spec 4.2 meter will work properly once more
- Improved c-style string implementation
- Home Assitant Auto-Discovery through MQTT integration
- Reboot instead of "Bailout" for 8266 (due to memory leak, means more reboots, but is stable)
- Support for WEMOS LOLIN32 (for Rob Roos)
- Minor improvements.
